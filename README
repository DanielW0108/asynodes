Asymptote library for TikZ-style "nodes".

Nodes contain text or pictures, bordered by a path, optionally with a filled background.
The contents and border path of a node cannot be changed after creation, but nodes can be moved and drawn onto a picture multiple times.
Nodes can return anchors corresponding to an arbitrary point along the border path, and be moved to an absolute position or moved relative to another node.
Nodes can also fetch paths between their own bounding paths and the bounding paths of other nodes.

To install, place nodes.asy in your %ASYMPTOTE_HOME directory (by default, ~\.asy).

See the "doc" folder for documentation.
